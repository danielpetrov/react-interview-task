Welcome! The goal of this task is to test your skills and also your code style. You are free to use this setup and
some of the development stack that comes with it, or you use your own implementation. This setup is only ment
to save time for setup your own project.

Some people working in company 'Out Of Space OOD', creating software work in an office. They take turns
in cleaning the whole office and have a paper on the wall where the person who last cleaned the room
signs his name and checks that he has done his 'job'. But paper kills trees. Some of the pretty girl colleagues
love trees!!! The guys from the office have decided to make them happy.
They are calling to aids for a HERO, who can write an clean-up sign up application,
which will help them sign up cleaning turns without killing trees.

    * remove record (when user clicks this the row will be removed from the table)
2. Button which when clicked opens up a form which on submit will add new record to the table
